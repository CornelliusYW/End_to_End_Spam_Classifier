This is a code repository collection for the NLP Machine Learning Spam Classifier end-to-end project. The article for this code will be attached here as soon as it has been published. The code is still incomplete as it's still in the process of cleaning up, so keep an eye on this repository.

### Aim
This project aims to develop a spam classifier model from the available email data and simulate how to deploy and maintain them.

### Procedure
We would follow the standard data science project for this project, including:

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Development
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Deployment
6. Model Maintenance

### Tech Stack
For this project, we would use various open-source tech stacks that are appropriate for each step, including:

1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. VS Code
4. Docker
5. Airflow
6. FastAPI

Additionally, we would use related Python packages common in data science projects. Some notable packages include:

1. MLFlow
2. Evidently
3. NLTK
4. Wordcloud

### Dataset

You can find the dataset in the storage folder (https://github.com/cornelliusyudhawijaya/End_to_End_Spam_Classifier/blob/master/storage/spam_emails.csv)
